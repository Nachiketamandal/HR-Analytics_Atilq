Hello Folks,
This is my First Power BI dashboard. I have used HR Data Analytics from Codebasics youtube channel. This is a totally real-time challenge of Pinali Mandalia - HR from AtliQ Technologies. hashtag#portfolioproject
The task was to build a Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to automate the working of HR.
**Requirements of HR:-**
â€¢	Working preferences of employees between Work From Home and Work From Office.
â€¢	Percentage of overall sick leave to monitor employee wellness.
â€¢	The reason behind the choice of work from home frequently.
â€¢	And most importantly learning the power BI basics through this project.
**Benefits:-**
â€¢	If she gets these insights from the data then she can plan some team-building activities or team lunches.
â€¢	The other benefit of getting these insights, just that if the company is going for the Hybrid Model ( Ex- WFH 2 days, WFO 3 days) working then she can do better capacity planning.
â€¢	Also, the company can use better utilization of space and saves some money on infrastructure after getting these types of insights.

1. Developed a Dashboard for Presence, Work From Home, and Sick Leave of the employees of AtliQ Technologies.

**Useful tips:-**
Use **Ctrl + Alt + V** to activate the paste special option and select transpose. This will paste your horizontal values vertically and vice-versa in Excel.
Right-click on the column to make the column transformation options appear in Power BI.
Use **CTRL + Click** to select multiple columns.
When you are excluding/transforming data, always think of a dynamic way so that it will work even with new data.
Uncheck "Use Original Column name as prefix" to keep column names short.
Keeping the measures in a separate table is a best practice that will organize them all in one place.
**CTRL + Scrolling** up inside the measure box will increase the font size.
We can create both DAX measures and Calculated Columns using DAX.
We can use the format option in column tools to change the date format as we like.
Try to provide real insights for your client/stakeholder ASAP to increase the engagement rate.
Arrange your most important insights at the top left as most people read from left to right.
A good insights report will enable you to ask more why's on the top KPIs.
